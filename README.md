# Jeremy's 42 School Project Portfolio

Welcome to my repository where I've curated projects completed during my time at [42 School Singapore](https://www.42singapore.com). Each project folder is a testament to the skills and knowledge I've developed in my coding journey.

## Projects Overview

Here, you'll find a variety of projects ranging from simple algorithms to complex software solutions. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in software development and my ability to tackle challenging problems. Note that every project includes a bonus that provides 25 marks on completion only if the base project has scored 100/100.
